Daily WhatsApp practice (what makes your content come alive)

Your daily prompts should feel like friendly conversation, not school.

Examples:

“Say hello and share one good thing about your day (20 seconds).”

“Describe your favorite food and why you like it.”

“Invite a friend to coffee (use this sentence).”

“What’s one goal you have this month?”

I would build a library of 56 prompts for an 8-week cohort so you never scramble.

Conversation Circle format (your weekly script)

A consistent script helps volunteers run great sessions without being expert teachers.

60-minute session flow

Warm welcome + quick check-in (5 mins)

Guided speaking round (15 mins)

Pair practice / breakout (15 mins)

Real-life roleplay (15 mins)

Celebrate wins + next-step challenge (10 mins)

Correction style: gentle and supportive. You correct patterns, not every mistake.

English Café (Brasília) content plan

Your Café should have stations that match the week’s theme:

“Introductions station”

“City life station”

“Work talk station”

“Games station” (the confidence builder)

“Beginner corner” (protected, slower pace)

People leave feeling: “I spoke more than I expected.”

Placement and progress (simple, not intimidating)

For V1, I’d use:

self-placement questions (“I can introduce myself confidently / sometimes / not yet”)

a short voice note sample (optional)

a simple pre/post speaking rubric:

clarity (1–5)

length (1–5)

confidence (1–5)

Progress should feel encouraging, not exam-like.

3) How I’d package all of this so you can publish on Replit easily

To make Replit feel like a real platform in V1, I would structure your content as:

A Cohort Home page (everything in one place)

A Week 1–Week 8 page set

A Downloads page (phrases, audio links)

An Events page for Brasília meetups

A Community page (WhatsApp rules, daily practice)

This keeps navigation simple and reduces drop-offs.

4) What I can produce next for you (so you have “brand assets + content” immediately)

If you want, I can generate a complete V1 kit in one go, including:

Brand kit

micro brand guide (tone, values, messaging)

homepage copy + About + FAQ + Safeguarding copy

WhatsApp templates (welcome messages + rules)

event invitation copy (English Café Brasília)

Content kit (ready to deliver)

full 8-week curriculum outline (Beginners + Confidence)

Week 1 written lesson (complete, ready to publish)

56 daily WhatsApp prompts (8 weeks)

Conversation Circle facilitator scripts (8 sessions)
