About (transparent and warm)

Horizonte English Community exists to help people grow in confidence and opportunity through English.
We are a community shaped by service and encouragement. Many of our volunteers are Christians, and we believe love should look practical. English is open to everyone, and faith conversations are always optional and respectful.

FAQ line (important)

Do I have to be Christian?
No. Everyone is welcome. Our English community is open to all.

2) Content: what you teach and how you deliver it

Now to the heart of it: your content must match your brand. That means it should feel:

practical

friendly

confidence-building

conversational

community-driven

The Horizonte learning model (simple, repeatable)

I’d structure your content around one weekly rhythm:

Weekly rhythm (works online + supports in-person)

Lesson (10–15 minutes): one clear topic + useful phrases

Daily practice (5–10 minutes/day): voice notes + micro prompts

Conversation Circle (60 minutes/week): guided speaking in small groups

Reflection + mini check (5 minutes): celebrate progress, set next step

This is the engine that creates real improvement without overwhelming people.

Your program tracks (V1)

To keep “everybody welcome,” I’d keep tracks clear and friendly:

Track 1: Foundations (Beginners)

Goal: speak in simple sentences without fear.

Track 2: Confidence (Low-intermediate)

Goal: speak longer, handle real-life situations, improve flow.

Track 3: English Café (Open Community)

Goal: social practice, friendships, low-pressure speaking.

Youth version

Same tracks, but:

more structure

shorter activities

stronger safeguarding rules

Your 8-week V1 content plan (community + real life)

This is a strong first cohort sequence that fits “Work & Life” while staying social:

Week 1: Welcome & Introductions

Names, where you’re from, what you like.
Community goal: everyone speaks on day one.

Week 2: Daily Life & Routines

Simple present, time phrases, daily habits.

Week 3: Places in the City (Brasília-friendly)

Directions, locations, asking for help, safe travel language.

Week 4: People & Relationships

Family, friends, invitations, making plans.

Week 5: Work & Skills (light, practical)

What you do, what you can do, teamwork language.

Week 6: Customer Conversations (life + work)

Ordering, booking, asking questions, polite responses.

Week 7: Problems & Solutions (confidence builder)

Explaining an issue, asking for help, staying calm.

Week 8: Your Story & Next Horizon

A short “my journey” talk + celebration + next steps.

Each week should include:

12–20 key phrases

1 sentence pattern (“I usually…”, “I’m going to…”, “Can you help me…?”)

1 pronunciation focus (very light)

1 community prompt (“Ask two people about…”)
